# findMe

Hi there!

This repo contains a findMe app that allows users to post missing people reports to a world-wide database. Anyone that goes to the website can view all the missing people reports, but they have to sign in if they want to post their own missing person report. The idea behind this app is to create more awareness of people that have gone missing in order to help find them.

Link, deployed to heroku: https://findmeapp1.herokuapp.com/

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Cloudinary.

Optimizations:

I'm still in the process of creating a couple of search features on the main page so visitors can search by region, date missing, and various other criteria. This single optimization would make this app significantly better. I also need to adjust the picture formating on the main page. I haven't figured out how to standardize the images being uploaded. Sometimes the pictures uploaded are displayed in dimensions that make the picture look distorted. I will also work on this the next time I have some spare time.

Lessons Learned:

I learned how to use Cloudinary.
I learned how to embed google map features in a full stacck web application.
I learned how to organize bigger projects with multiple routes.
I improved my understanding of middleware and local auth.
